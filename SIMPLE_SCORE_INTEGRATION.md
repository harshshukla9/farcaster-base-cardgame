### **4. Direct Contract Call**
```typescript
const handleSubmitScore = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("🔍 Submitting score:", gameState.score)
    
    // Get Farcaster user data from context
    const farcasterUsername = context?.user?.username || "Anonymous"
    const farcasterFid = context?.user?.fid || 0
    const farcasterPfp = context?.user?.pfpUrl || ""
    
    // Call setScore directly - no modal needed
    setScore(gameState.score)
}, [gameState.score, context, setScore])
```
